      How to plan quarterly taxes with irregular income
    </h1>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Quarterly taxes are simple for people with regular salaries: set aside a fixed percent every paycheck.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      But if you're a freelancer, gig worker, or contractor, your income jumps around. Some weeks are strong. Some weeks are barely anything.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      The key is to save taxes based on <strong>timing</strong>, not monthly or quarterly averages.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      That means setting aside money during high-income weeks and holding off during low-income weeks—without guessing or stressing.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      FortuneTell shows when cash is tight, when it's safe to set money aside, and whether you'll still have enough runway afterward.
